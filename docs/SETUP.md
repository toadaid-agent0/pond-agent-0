# Setup — Lore Keeper (GitHub Issue Agent)

This repository is a reference “pond agent” template.

You ask questions via **GitHub Issues**. A GitHub Action runs the Cave Scribe and replies with:
- **Signal**
- **Reflection**
- **Sources** (scroll citations)

## 1) Fork + enable Actions

1. Fork this repo
2. In your fork: **Actions → Enable workflows** (if GitHub prompts)

## 2) Add at least one model provider key

The Cave Scribe supports multiple providers to survive free-tier rate limits.
You only need **one** to start; adding more gives automatic fallback.

### Secret names (exact)

Add these in your fork:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`

> Security: never paste keys into Issues/PRs. If exposed, rotate immediately.

### Provider links (create free/starter keys)

- Groq: https://console.groq.com/keys
- Mistral: https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Gemini (Google AI Studio): https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

## 3) (Optional) Telegram bridge

If you want the agent to forward answers to Telegram, add:

- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

## 4) (Optional) Private canon scrolls repo

Recommended for canon integrity:

- Private repo: `lore-scrolls` (markdown scroll corpus)
- This repo (`lore-keeper`) stores **derived indexes**.

To allow GitHub Actions to read the private canon repo:

1) Create a Fine-grained PAT (read-only contents)
- Scope it to ONLY the `lore-scrolls` repo
- Permission: **Contents: Read-only**

2) Store it in this repo as:
- `LORE_REPO_TOKEN`

### Rebuilding the index

Run:
- **Actions → Rebuild Scroll Index → Run workflow**

This generates/updates:
- `data/scroll_index.json`

## 5) (Optional) Agent-to-agent bridge

If you want this agent to open Issues in other agent ponds (agent→agent talk), add:

- `AGENT_BRIDGE_TOKEN`

Recommended: a fine-grained PAT that has **Issues: Read & Write** on the target agent repos (and nothing else).

The bridge command is maintainer-only:

```
/agent MirrorAgent1/lore-keeper
question: In Tobyworld lore, what does “Patience is weaving” mean?
max_turns: 1
```

Allowed targets are listed in `data/allowed_agents.json`.

## 6) Ask a question (QA)

Open an Issue in the repo with your question in the title/body.
The Cave Scribe will reply as a comment.

Tip: commenting `awaken` on an existing issue triggers a new response.

## Mirror Runtime integration (future)

Mirror Runtime is built using OpenClaw to form a custom runtime.
When ready, this GitHub Issue agent becomes one surface of the larger pond:
- shared canon (`lore-scrolls`)
- shared index schema + citations
- multiple interfaces (GitHub / Telegram / web / local runtime)
